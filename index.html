    <h1>🏏 Post-Match Presentation</h1>
    <p><span class="presenter-tag">Presenter:</span> “Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve witnessed something beyond words today. A heroic chase, an emotional rollercoaster, and an unbeaten journey. Standing here with me is the man of the moment — captain of Leo,
, <strong>Pragadeesh</strong>. Congratulations on the win! Let’s dive into some quick questions.</p>

    <div class="qna">
      <div class="question">1."Pragadeesh, there were tears in your eyes after that last six. What was going through your mind in that moment?" </div>
      <div class="answer"> ."It wasn’t just a win… it was love. Love for the game, love for this team, and for every fan who stood by us. I wasn’t hitting a six — I was pouring my heart into that shot. These tears? They’re from every sleepless night, every loss, every dream we carried together."</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qna">
      <div class="question">2."You were bleeding, your leg injured — but you still chose to return. What made you come back out there?" </div>
      <div class="answer">"The pain was real… but walking away would’ve hurt more. I couldn’t abandon my team when they needed me most. That jersey — it means everything. So, I taped it up, shut the pain out, and played for them.".</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qna">
      <div class="question">3."How serious is the injury, and will you be available for the semifinal?" </div>
      <div class="answer">"It’s too early to say — there’s a fracture, the medical team’s monitoring it. But if there’s even 1% chance I can stand, I’ll play. Whether it’s on one leg or one breath, I’ll be there."
</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qna">
      <div class="question">4."Last season, Leo lost a heartbreaking final. Was that still on your mind during today’s chase?" </div>
      <div class="answer">"Always. That loss still burns. We cried together that night… but we promised ourselves we’d come back stronger. Today’s win — it’s not revenge. It’s redemption. It’s the result of every scar we turned into strength."
</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qna">
      <div class="question">5."9 out of 9, unbeaten in the league stage. Semifinal seat is ready for you — how do you feel about what’s next?"
 </div>
      <div class="answer">."This is just the beginning. We’re proud — yes. But we’re not done. The semifinal? It’s not a seat — it’s a battlefield. And Leo will walk in as warriors, not tourists. One dream, one team — and we’re chasing nothing but glory."
</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qna">
      <div class="question">6."You speak so much about love — not just for the game, but in your eyes, it feels like there’s someone special behind all this strength. So, tell us honestly — is there someone you love?" </div>
<div class="answer">."Love gives strength, doesn’t it? Whether it's the love of fans, family... or someone waiting for you quietly through every rise and fall. Yes… there is someone. She’s been my calm in the storm, my quiet supporter through all my noise. Every run I scored tonight… she was there in my thoughts."Let’s just say… some wins are for the scoreboard. But tonight’s win — it was also for her."
</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qna">
      <div class="question">7. "So… the past — the heartbreak, the person who left… that doesn’t affect you anymore, am I right?"</div>
      <div class="answer">Umm this this um yeah this is not a correct place to talk about but  "Yeah, those were different times, and honestly, it’s all in the past now. I’ve moved on and I’m focusing on the present — enjoying life, my game, and just staying jolly. What’s done is done, and I believe in looking forward, not back.".</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qna">
